The GitHub-Portfolio-Project concludeds the first ten weeks of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Developer Boot Camp.

## Description of Project 

We started off this project by creating a div element in HTML and using CSS to set attributes to make the div resemble a ball. We then used JavaScript to control the position of the ball and added code to create dynamic movement. Our assignment was to simply set up a boundary and have the ball bounce back when it hit the wall. We were instructed to continue playing with the code after we completed the assignment and see what else we could do with it. 

I added additional code to have movement along two dimentions, added a second ball, added a function that randomly changed the ball's attributes (color, height, and width) when it hit the boundaries, and turned one ball into a "golden snitch". The golden snitch ball has a function that randomly changes the ball's velocity and direction.
