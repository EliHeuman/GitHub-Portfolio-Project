The GitHub-Portfolio-Project concludeds the first ten weeks of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Developer Boot Camp.

## Description of the Project 
Importing boot strap to this project help speed up production and styling.  The project has two pages linked by a Navbar. The landing page has a Bio, and a short video, and the projects page showcases the projects I worked on during the past weeks at the MIT course.

## How to Run
I added additional code to have movement along two dimentions, added a second ball, added a function that randomly changed the ball's attributes (color, height, and width) when it hit the boundaries, and turned one ball into a "golden snitch". The golden snitch ball has a function that randomly changes the ball's velocity and direction.
